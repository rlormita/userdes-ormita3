	</div>
	<section class="page-section portfolio" id="portfolio">
    <div class="container">
                <p align="left">If there is a 1000 floor building and I would design the interface of the elevator to it.  
				We should consider that there are many people are there in the building. One elevator is not enough to cater the population of the 1000 floor building. 
				I will base the no. of elevators to the Burj Khalifa which is the tallest building in the world that has 163 floors. 
				</p>
				<p align="left">According to Momin, W. (2019), the building Burj Khalifa has 57 elevators and 8 escalators. 
				elevators have a capacity of 12 to 14 cabin, the fastest rising and descending at up to 10m/s for double-deck elevators.
				</p>
				<p align="left"><b>Do the math: </b></p>
				<p align="left">163 floors = 57 elevators </p>
				<p align="left">11000 / 163 = 6.135 x 57 (elevators) = 349.70 (round-off) = <b>350 elevators</b>. </p>
				<p align="left">I am assuming that 350 elevators are enough to cater the population in the 1000 floor building. 
				To avoid people waiting in line, not all elevators cater the 1000 floors. I will group the elevators into odd and even scheme based on the elevator in Asia Pacific College. 
				Also, I will add the feature of an express elevator that caters every hundredth floor and for the 1000th floor.
				</p>
				<p align="left"><b>Do the math: </b></p>
				<p align="left">350 elevators / 3 = 116 with a remainder 2</p>
				<p align="left">Why 3? Because it is for the three schemes of the elevator which is odd, even and express.</p>
				<p align="left">&#8226; <b>116 odd elevators </b> – caters 500 floors because there are 500 odd numbers in a 1000</p>
				<p align="left">&#8226; <b>116 even elevators </b> – caters 500 floors because there are 500 even numbers in a 1000</p>
				<p align="left">&#8226; <b>116 express elevators </b> – caters every 100th floor to 1000th floor on the building</p>
				<p align="left">&#8226; <b>2 elevator lifts </b> – this where all the heavy packages will go through. This will also have an odd and even scheme. </p>
				<p align="left">On every elevator it has the capacity of 12 to 14 persons based on the capacity of the Burj Khalifa’s elevator. 
				The 1000 floor building elevator will have the capacity of 2000kg or 4000lbs. 
				According to elevation-fandom, the standard limit of an elevator capacity of high-rise buildings are close to 4,000 lbs.
				</p>
				<p align="left">The elevator lift will have the capacity of 5,900kg. It is based on the largest passenger elevator in Sumitomo Fudosan Roppongi Grand Tower in Japan, 
				that has a size of 3.35 width x 3.15m in depth that can accommodate 90 persons with a maximum capacity of 5800kg.

				</p>
				<p align="left">
				On every elevator, there would be a keypad 0-9, in which the user will input the floor number he/she wanted to go.
				If the user had a mistake in entering a number, the user will input 0-0-0-0 to enter again their desired. There is also an emergency button at the top of the panel, in case of an emergency happened. 
				On an express elevator, there would be a button for 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 1000.  A button will glow red when a button is pressed.
				</p>
				<p align="left">
				<b>Speed of the Elevator:</b> The speed of the elevator to a 1000 floor building is 3,313 feet per minute which is based to the world’s fastest elevator which is the Taipei101 according to Willet, M. (2013). 
				Due to the number of floors, it would take time for the users to reach its floor destination. Inside the elevator, there would be foldable seats to make the users comfortable and a television that would entertain them.
				</p>
				<p align="left">
				Outside the elevator, there would be a signage at the top to tell if it is an odd, even, express or a lift. There is a screen beside the elevator that would tell the status where the elevator is. 
				Also, there is an up and a down button, to tell the elevator if the user is going up or going down.
				</p>

				<b>SUMMARY ELEVATOR DETAILS</b> <br>
				<b>No. of elevator: </b> <br>
				350 (116-odd floors, 116-even floors, 116-every 100th floor, 1 elevator lift – odd floors, and 1 elevator lift – even floors)<br>
				<b>Elevator Capacity:</b> 2,000kgs (standard limit of high-rise building)<br>
				<b>Elevator lift Capacity:</b> 5800kgs (capacity of the world’s largest elevator)<br>
				<b>Speed of the elevator:</b> 3,313feet/min (speed of the Taipei101 elevator)<br>
				Odd and even floors have keypad features while express have buttons to be pressed.<br>
				Inside the elevator has foldable seats and T.V.<br>
